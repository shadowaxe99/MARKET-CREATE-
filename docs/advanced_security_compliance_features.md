# Advanced Security and Compliance Features

## Enhanced Wallet Security

In the Elysium Marketplace, the security of our users' wallets is of utmost importance. We have implemented several measures to ensure the safety and integrity of user funds.

### Biometric Security Measures

To provide an additional layer of security, we have integrated biometric authentication methods for wallet access. This includes fingerprint scanning and facial recognition, which are supported by most modern devices.

```typescript
import { BiometricAuth } from 'src/utils/security';

export const enableBiometricSecurity = async () => {
  try {
    const isBiometricSupported = await BiometricAuth.isSupported();
    if (isBiometricSupported) {
      await BiometricAuth.enable();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error enabling biometric security:', error);
  }
};
```

### Insurance-Backed Wallet Options

For users engaging in high-value transactions, we offer insurance-backed wallet options. This insurance provides coverage against potential losses due to security breaches or unauthorized access.

```typescript
import { WalletInsurance } from 'src/utils/security';

export const applyForWalletInsurance = async (walletId: string, coverageAmount: number) => {
  try {
    const insurancePolicy = await WalletInsurance.apply(walletId, coverageAmount);
    return insurancePolicy;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error applying for wallet insurance:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## Compliance Monitoring

Our platform is designed to be fully compliant with the latest regulations. We employ automated tools that continuously monitor our systems to ensure adherence to laws and guidelines.

### Automated Compliance Checks

We have developed a system that performs automated compliance checks, ensuring that all transactions and user activities are within legal boundaries.

```javascript
const { ComplianceMonitor } = require('src/utils/compliance');

const monitorCompliance = async () => {
  try {
    const complianceResult = await ComplianceMonitor.runChecks();
    if (!complianceResult.isCompliant) {
      // Handle non-compliance issues
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error running compliance checks:', error);
  }
};

module.exports = {
  monitorCompliance,
};
```

### Real-Time Alerts

In case of any compliance issues or irregularities, our system generates real-time alerts to notify the relevant teams, allowing for immediate action.

```javascript
const { AlertService } = require('src/utils/alerts');

const sendComplianceAlert = (alertData) => {
  try {
    AlertService.send('COMPLIANCE_ISSUE', alertData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending compliance alert:', error);
  }
};

module.exports = {
  sendComplianceAlert,
};
```

By implementing these advanced security features and compliance monitoring tools, Elysium Marketplace ensures a secure and trustworthy environment for all users.
